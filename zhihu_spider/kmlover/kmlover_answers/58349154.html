谢邀。今晚喝多了，明天来回答。<br><br>2015.08.10补答：<br><br>看到这个标题，我第一时间想到了一位来中国举重队训练过的外国队员的见闻感受：<br><br>Quote:<br>Originally Posted by <strong>kirksman</strong><br>Previously I remember seeing some big names smoking. But they're like, don't tell anyone about it. Do they still though?<br>This is gonna burst some bubbles but yeah they do! i drank with a few one night and they all basically smoke... when i had brunch with coach Hao (this is most likely spelled wrong but i only have his business card in mandarin) but he is the assitant coach in the army team gym so he works as an assistant coach to coach Yu Jie and i don't need to introduce him  He is also best friend's with Lu Xiaojun and Liao Hui who apparently smoke and drink as well. Also Lu Xiaojun is apparently a proficient drinker as well... He said Lu can easily down 24 beers and go train heavy the next morning and have no isssues...He said Both guys drank almost every weekend, of course near competition this does not happen. But back to the smoking, Coach Hao is a former national champion at 77kg himself best lifts 165/195 and the dude smokes 2 packs a day and had been smoking since he was 13...Most Coaches smoked! There are no taboos to smoking inside so in social settings or over food most would smoke. The only time i didn't notice them smoke was in the gym during training but they would step out sometimes to smoke. the Athletes are allowed to drink n smoke only on weekends or if they are happy for a occasion or if coach is away lol.. <br><br>One night i was asked to join Coach Ma over dinner with some of the coaches from the university. In attendance were head coach weightlifting, assistant coach weightlifting, travelling weightlifting coach, tae kwon do coach, strength and conditioning, badminton and Coach Ma. Almost all of them had produced International/National medalists These guys could drink! and they drank some crazy white wine that is 72% alcohol. The stuff tasted and smelt like nail polish remover lol... They discussed training, olympic spirit, medals and weightlifting it was amazing. The one thing they most agreed on was athlete mental toughness and confidence. They said no matter what they knew or were able to coach, it didn't matter if the athlete wasn't strong mentally he would never reach his true potential. This is from Coach Hao but he also said that Lu Xiaojun is better in training than competition, his best 180/220. Liao hui and Su Dajin he said were competition freaks and Liao Hui is the strongest Chinese athlete.<br><br>出处：<a class=" wrap external" href="http://www.pendlayforum.com/showpost.php%3Fs%3Da1d5b1a5a91c7c2f0941c416e2913954%26p%3D94105%26postcount%3D75" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Pendlay Forum<i class="icon-external"></i></a><br><br>所以，酒精的影响是有的，但抵不过训练的作用，在训练科学刻苦+营养充足+不滥饮酗酒的前提下，偶尔喝点也没什么。
